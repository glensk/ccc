# claude-command-center

## Purpose

A command center that organizes Claude Code sessions across projects by user-defined categories, tracking each session's AIM (a concrete done-condition), progress against that AIM as a checklist bar, and live status. The tool solves context fragmentation by centralizing session visibility and introducing "future jobs" — described work that can be parked and launched later from terminal, TUI, or Obsidian — externalizing memory and routing around rate limits.

## Key Capabilities

- **AIM-driven sessions**: Every session carries a stated done-condition; vague AIMs are flagged and auto-sharpened from file context and task state
- **Interactive TUI**: Cards grouped by category, live progress bars, session resumption from new tabs, optional browser UI (`ccc serve`)
- **Future jobs**: Park ideas as AIM + repo + optional prompt; launch later from CLI, TUI, or Obsidian buttons; support job dependencies
- **Optional LLM features**: Auto-derive sub-goals and grade progress; drift detection; independent AIM-met checker
- **Shell integration**: `c` wrapper asks for AIM before launching Claude, seeding the session automatically
- **Obsidian mirrors**: Every session as a searchable markdown note with job-launch buttons
- **Background daemon**: Auto-reaps idle sessions, regenerates summaries, desktop notifications (launchd/systemd)
- **Auto-resume halted**: Resume rate-limit-blocked sessions once limits reset
- **macOS extras**: Karabiner hotkeys, iTerm2 integration, AppKit-based peek panel
